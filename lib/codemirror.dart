   * [atomic]: atomic ranges act as a single unit when cursor movement is
   * concerned â€” i.e. it is impossible to place the cursor inside of them. In
   * atomic ranges, inclusiveLeft and inclusiveRight have a different meaning â€”
   * they will prevent the cursor from being placed respectively directly before
   * and directly after the range.
   * [collapsed]: collapsed ranges do not show up in the display. Setting a
   * range to be collapsed will automatically make it atomic.
   * [clearOnEnter]: when enabled, will cause the mark to clear itself whenever
   * the cursor enters its range. This is mostly useful for text - replacement
   * widgets that need to 'snap open' when the user tries to edit them. The

   * the editor will capture mouse and drag events occurring in this widget.
   * Default is false â€” the events will be left alone for the default browser
   * handler, or specific handlers on the widget, to capture.
   * [readOnly]: a read-only span can, as long as it is not cleared, not be
   * modified except by calling setValue to reset the whole document. Note:
   * adding a read-only span currently clears the undo history of the editor,
   * because existing undo events being partially nullified by read-only spans
   * would corrupt the history (in the current implementation).
   * [addToHistory]: when set to true (default is false), adding this marker
   * will create an event in the undo history that can be individually undone
   * (clearing the marker).
   * [startStyle]: can be used to specify an extra CSS class to be applied to
   * the leftmost span that is part of the marker.
   * [endStyle]: equivalent to startStyle, but for the rightmost span.
   * [css] a string of CSS to be applied to the covered text. For example
   * "color: #fe3".
   * [title]: when given, will give the nodes created for this span a HTML title
   * attribute with the given value.

   * set shared to true to make the marker appear in all documents. By default,
   * a marker appears only in its target document.

   * atomic ranges, inclusiveLeft and inclusiveRight have a different meaning â€”
   * they will prevent the cursor from being placed respectively directly before

   * range to be collapsed will automatically make it atomic.
   * [clearOnEnter]: when enabled, will cause the mark to clear itself whenever

   * the editor will capture mouse and drag events occurring in this widget.
   * Default is false â€” the events will be left alone for the default browser
   * handler, or specific handlers on the widget, to capture.

   * adding a read-only span currently clears the undo history of the editor,
   * because existing undo events being partially nullified by read-only spans
   * would corrupt the history (in the current implementation).
   * [addToHistory]: when set to true (default is false), adding this marker
   * will create an event in the undo history that can be individually undone
   * (clearing the marker).
   * [startStyle]: can be used to specify an extra CSS class to be applied to
   * the leftmost span that is part of the marker.
   * [endStyle]: equivalent to startStyle, but for the rightmost span.
   * [css] a string of CSS to be applied to the covered text. For example
   * "color: #fe3".
   * [title]: when given, will give the nodes created for this span a HTML title
   * attribute with the given value.
